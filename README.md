# Meet App

## Project Overview
The Meet App is a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) developed with React using a test-driven development (TDD) approach. The application leverages the Google Calendar API to fetch and display upcoming events and offers advanced features such as offline usage and data visualization.

### Objective
The primary goal is to create a high-quality, responsive application that meets the latest web development trends, including serverless architecture and PWA functionalities. The use of TDD ensures robust and reliable code while providing immediate feedback during development.

## Features
1. **Filter Events By City:** Users can search for and filter events by city to focus on specific locations.
2. **Show/Hide Event Details:** Users can show or hide event details to view only the relevant information.
3. **Specify Number of Events:** Users can control the number of events displayed on the screen.
4. **Use the App When Offline:** The app provides offline support, enabling access to cached event data.
5. **Add an App Shortcut to the Home Screen:** Users can install the app as a shortcut for quicker access.
6. **Display Charts Visualizing Event Details:** Visual charts help users better understand event trends and statistics.
